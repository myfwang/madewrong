I tried to make the gaps bewteen the stitching larger to save time. I realised I like closer stitching better. Large gaps makes the gimp look not enclosed properly.

Another thing I did this time is I cut more fabric out. Instead of just the hole I cut triangles out extending from the hole to make the key shape

Thoughts and improvement:

- pretty good this time, though consistency is needed
- need to improve finishing, especially once I bring the gimp to the bacl, and enclosing
