I think Im getting the hang of this. Everything is coming together to become consistent. 

I think there are 3 main things that are bringing me success:
1. Being patient
2. Marking the outline with chalk and staying aware of the outline with preset overlock thread with the all purpose thread
3. Trying my best to make sure the needle pokes through the fabric at a 90 degree angle

We need to do more iterations to keep it steady, also my finishing of the gimp thread and finishing stitches were the best so far this time around.

PS Im thinking of adding a backend to this, the images stored in my static folder is already getting a bit too crowded to my liking.
