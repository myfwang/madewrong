As I'm trying to perfect my skills one of the biggest gripes that I face has to be buttonholes. Though machine button holes are very nice, in particular Reese keyhole buttonholes, you need specific machines for those which is out of reach for me.

My home sewing machine comes with a button hole setting, however its just a slit. Not what I'm looking for. So to overcome these troubles I'm going to be doing a hand sewn buttonhole a day, in order to speed up my time doing it and perfecting it too.

This is my first attempt at one... total time taken: nearly 2 hrs

Thoughts:

- overall not too bad I would say, especially for a first try
- I started on the right side, and progressed clockwise.
- on the bottom where I started, I was having trouble starting the top stitch, especially locking the gimp thread in place

Areas of improvement:

- Ensuring needle is at a 90 degree angle when sewing through the fabric
- overlocking at first with a different thread. Probably a thin all purpose thread
- ensure even spacing and starting next to the previous stitch
