I know that progress isnt linear, but its looking quite exponential here :boom:

This is the same day as day 5 but I did it in the AM and not the PM so we count it as different days

Thoughts:
- took me about an hr, but I also went to do the laundry so maybe took me around 50 mins? Could be quicker. If I could get these results under 40 mins Id be quite happy
