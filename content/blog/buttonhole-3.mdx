Is anyone even reading this? Probably not, that doesnt matter though we keep going.

Currently my denim is fraying where I'm putting the stitch in, this is either because the bulkiness of the threaded knot is damaging the denim or because I'm pulling the thread too tightly when I'm doing the stitch.

Thoughts:
- I'm not sure what happened when I was stitching the lower bit, but I think my thread got tangled up and caused it to look ugly, so I need to pay attention more to positioning of my thread
- Maybe draw an outline of where I want my top stitching thread so we can stay consistent
- Make sure thread doesnt get tangled when we are doing the backstitch at the end
