Humbly, this buttonhole may be the most perfect one Ive done yet. Stitching all have quite equal spacing, and the length of the stitching are all quite consistent too. 

If all my buttonholes were to look like this, I'd be a happy man.

Improvements for the future:
- time
- gmip thread placement for the back, and overall quality of look of the back
