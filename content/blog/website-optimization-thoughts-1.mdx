I enjoy being inspired my people I look up to. The reason my website home page is quite empty so far is because I dont have the vision captured for it yet. :sadge:

Store fronts such as acne, or object22 have great home pages Im inspired by, but I think a video that loops would be much cooler

Also, backend is a must at this point, if I switch devices, cloning this repo will take *forever*. I already have supabase connected to it to store client info and order details, but tbh I dont really see the use case for that anymore, as most clients will most likely be a one or two time thing. 

So all in all Ill connect the supabase up for the images.

Heres a photo of the current state of the static folder for some insight, keep in mind this is 5 days of really using the site, although Im having 3-4 images in each blog, but this is the least crowded it will be.

Im smiling to myself right now, since its pretty ironic that Im adding an image to the folder to complain about it being crowded LOL
